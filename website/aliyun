When I first-time want to build a simple website, just really simple
But I met many problems !
Firstly I go for bilibili TOP video which teach you how to build a website, 
however I stuck for almost 2 hours trying to find why a step just doesnt work for me
During the process, I try for blogger website, xiaohongshu for help. However, all seem not work
Until I find a recent clear blog with the exact same product that I use! 
Then everything become easy.

SO WHEN YOU STEP INTO SOME PRACTICAL SOLUTION AREA 
THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING FOR YOU IS TO FIND A PROCESS BLOG (MUCH QUICKER THAN VIDEO)WITH A FULL WORKOUT PROCESS 
WHICH IS PUBLISHED MOST RECENTLY AND DO THE EXACT SAME THING AS YOU!!!
